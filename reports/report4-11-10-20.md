Report 4:

Lots of commits since report 2. Made a tree ADT specific to my concept of the othello decision tree, where each node has n children depicting the possible moves for the current players turn. Made an AI helper class for a function that develops a decision tree with n depth for a current board position and player. Made a start function for AI gameplay that I plan to merge with the 2p function later. Have plans for a main menu in the gui eventually.

I fixed the  one major bug I've encountered so far, the SE bug, where legal moves weren't being found in the SE position due to a typo.

My goals are now to thread parts of the AI to improve performance,
Make a main menu with game type options
