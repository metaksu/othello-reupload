Milestone 2: Two-person play with a text-based interface

I'm 95% of the way to achieving milestone two.

The board can initialize a real game.
The board can check if a player has any legal moves
The board can skip a players turn if they do not have any legal moves
The board can keep track of the current player
The board can count up scores of each player individually
The board can display itself neatly in console (nothing too fancy yet, will improve in the future)
The board can display score
The board can prompt users to input the coordinate of the piece they want to place
The board can play a piece given by the user and flip others accordingly
The board can detect when the game is over
The board can display possible moves to a user (I plan on making a mode where you can enable this)


I need to figure out how to rank board positions by things other than the score. I still need to copy the board, but this is fairly trivial just havent coded it. 

Because I already have the function to display possible moves based on the current board position, I think it'll be really easy to transition into the AI portion of this assignment as that's the first step in the AI decision making process.

Going to spend a few days attempting the AI before I turn in report 3. Seems like a waste to turn in report 3 "on time" but without substance. 

Having more fun with the project than I thought I would and I still expect to get all the milestones done + more.
