Developing the Board Abstract Data Type:

I developed 2 ADT's for this. The board and tiles. The board is comprised of a double pointer of tiles and a boardstate (enum). Tiles hold the row, column coordinates and the piece that is on them. Tiles are stored in the board double pointer with the following equation: (8*row) + column, where row and column are both from 0-7. Since the board is 64 tiles large and that is fundamental to the game, I malloc exactly 64 tiles worth of space to the double pointer. I then initialize all the tiles to none, and depending on whether I want a game board or an empty board, I can choose to place the center starting pieces accordingly. 

Since I'm doing this report along with report 2, I will only talk about the milestone objectives in regard to each progress report. 

The board can tell if its full
The board can insert a piece with color into a given position, and flip pieces accordingly. 
The board can verify that the inserted piece is a legal move.
The board can be initialized to starting configuration
The board cannot be copied just yet...
The board cannot be compared just yet...
