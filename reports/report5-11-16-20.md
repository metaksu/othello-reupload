Report 5:

Not the most progress this week, however, I did add a ton of method-describing comments and I created a main menu game type selection screen and function to go along with it. There are 4 gamemodes now, 2player, easy cpu, medium cpu, and hard cpu, where the depth of the tree is 1, 3, and 5 respectively. Next big thing to tackle is unit tests and to continue fleshing out comments for some of the thicker methods. 

My goals are now to thread parts of the computer player to improve performance,
I want to add a countdown timer for the 2-player mode that allows for a time per turn to be set in a similar fashion to chess,
Need to figure out how to clean up my tree memory leak without destroying the board we're playing on... getting frustrated with this one because I've tried a bunch of stuff,
Add more comments,
Add formal unit tests,
Continue code clean up and function merges / modulation
